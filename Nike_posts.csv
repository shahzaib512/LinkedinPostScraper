"The face you make when you make history. Nike athlete Faith Kipyegon earned her third Olympic gold medal today in the Women’s 1,500 Meter — the first athlete to ever have three golds in the distance — with a time of 3:51.29, setting a new Olympic record.The 30-year-old Kenyan runner is the current world record holder for both the mile and the 1,500 meter — and she broke her own record last month during the Paris Diamond League event with a time of 3:49.04 in the 1,500 meter. Representing Team Kenya, her previous two Olympic Golds were in the 1,500 meter, earned in Rio and Tokyo respectively. Faith is a member of the Nike Athlete Think Tank, a collective of influential athletes that the brand learns from to champion women and girls in sport, inform innovative product creation, and create meaningful experiences.A mother of a six-year-old daughter, Faith shares that “I want to empower women to know that anything is possible. You can go on maternity leave and come back as strong as before — or stronger. Being a mother is something special, and it makes you stronger.

"This is what happens when you have relentless belief.The U.S. Women’s National Team claimed Olympic gold in the final match today at the storied Parc Des Princes in Paris. The victory marks their seventh Olympic medal — and fifth gold — as they’ve made it to the medal podium in every Olympic Games except one since women’s football made its Olympic debut in 1996.Mallory Swanson’s solo goal in the 57th minute secured the 1-0 victory for the Americans.Head coach Emma Hayes, the long-time head coach of Chelsea FC, put together a young and talented 18-player roster that she knew would have the power, positioning and passion to win as a team.Headlining Team USA was first-time Olympian Naomi Girma, who was the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) Defender of the Year in 2022 and 2023, as well as U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year in 2023. Last season’s NWSL Golden Boot winner and Portland Thorns forward Sophia Smith, who also made her Olympic debut, played alongside three-time Olympian and forward Crystal Dunn, midfielder Rose Lavelle, and forward Mallory Swanson. “As a child, anything I did, I didn’t see a point unless I was doing it to win,” Smith told Nike earlier this year. “The only way to have a victory is winning a gold medal.”Check out all the stories on our inspiring Nike athletes here: https://lnkd.in/gfSdageahashtag#Paris2024 hashtag#Olympics hashtag#JustDoIt

"Did you see that breakaway?! Nike athlete Sifan Hassan claimed gold today in the women’s marathon, clocking a time of 2:22:55, separating herself from a pack of three in the last minutes of the race.The medal was her third of the Paris Games, as she secured bronze in the 5,000 meter on August 5 and 10,000 meter on August 9. She is the first athlete to complete this triple feat since Czech runner Emil Zátopek swept gold in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.“When running, sometimes I feel good…and sometimes I feel bad and feel like I can’t continue,” says the 31-year-old Dutch athlete. “Life is the same way, and that’s what makes life beautiful, the way it goes up and down.” As of late July, the versatile runner ranked as the 22nd-fastest woman in the 1,500 meter, seventh-fastest in the 5,000 meter, ninth-fastest in the 10,000 meter and second-fastest in the marathon.In 2021, she became the only athlete in Olympic history to medal in the 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000 meter events at the same Olympics Games. Last fall, Sifan won the 2023 Chicago Marathon — and achieved the second-fastest women’s marathon finish of all time — in 2:13:44.Check out all the stories on our inspiring Nike athletes here: https://lnkd.in/gfSdageahashtag#Paris2024 hashtag#Olympics hashtag#JustDoIt

"Yep, that one went well 👍 In 13:13.66 time, Nike athlete Jakob Ingebrigtsen won gold in Paris in the 5,000-meter race, his second final race of the week after taking fourth in the 1,500 meter on Tuesday. This is his second Olympic gold after winning the 1,500 meter in Tokyo in 2021.“Every part of me is about winning. It's the most important thing, and it’s what I’m going to chase,” says the Norwegian middle-distance runner. “To be able to win, you need to visualize yourself as the best. I need to see myself on top of my opponents to be able to win.” When he was 16 years old, he became the youngest man in history to run a mile in less than 4 minutes. Jakob has since shattered records, including clocking two miles in under 8 minutes — a feat matched by only one other runner in the world. Now, the 23-year-old is one of the world leaders in both the mile and the 5,000 meter.Jakob attributes his success in part to his drive to compete against his two older brothers, Henrik and Filip. “When I was young, saying that I wanted to be like my brother was synonymous with saying, ‘I want to beat them,’” he says. “Weirdly, we feel like we’re part of each other’s process when we achieve some kind of success.”The three Ingebrigtsen brothers paced with Eliud Kipchoge for Breaking2. “Seeing the level of athletes who trained alongside him was crazy,” says Jakob. “At the end of the day, we all have the same goal: to see how fast human beings can go at different distances. We’re competing for that honor, but we’re also united by that competition.”Check out all the stories on our inspiring Nike athletes here: https://lnkd.in/gfSdageahashtag#Paris2024 hashtag#Olympics hashtag#JustDoIt

"“There are still so many stigmas around motherhood, especially through the lens of sport,” says Fanny Yung Ho, Nike Senior Manager, Design Innovation.  “Our team asked ourselves, how do we break down those barriers? How do we celebrate motherhood more?” The answer: the Nike (M) Swoosh Bra — the brand’s first nursing sports bra that’s compatible with wearable breast pumps, allowing mothers to unlock movement without compromising comfort or support. The bra has proprietary Nike hardware that helps ensure the clips stand up to lunges and burpees while pumping, along with offering easy access for nursing and adjustability for up to two full cup sizes. “With this bra, we want to empower women to say, ‘Here I am — I’m pumping, I’m moving, I’m proud to be a mom, I’m proud to be an athlete, and I can be both at the same time,'” says Ho.

"Step inside District 23. No really, step inside. We’re giving you a fly-through look at Jordan Brand’s Parisian hub, located in the city’s brilliant 18th arrondissement. D23 is Jordan’s love letter to the diasporic cultures and international youth who inform basketball and all its dimensions — a living, breathing example of how to use sport’s greatest stage as an accelerator for lasting impact that serves the entire community, particularly the next generation.Leading the way as creative director is Youssouf Fofana, founder of the fashion label Maison Château Rouge. His vision takes form in an unforgettable six-week stretch of programming that Fofana has cultivated inside and around the historic former Tati Barbès department store, which has been renovated to offer a space for creativity and community.On the product front, one of his most memorable collaborations was a special Air Jordan I Mid, which took rich design cues from the contemporary African diaspora in Paris. So, how did his creative mindset change from designing a shoe to designing an entire building? Turns out, not much. “The two processes were very similar,” says Youssouf. “When you talk about that AJ I Mid, it was inspired by the neighborhood, by the diversity of its community. When I designed this space for District 23, I was also inspired by the community. The response from the people here has been so positive. When they see a collaboration between Jordan Brand and a local artist, and they go big, it inspires everybody.” Learn more about District 23 at https://lnkd.in/gZQ5WZn6hashtag#JordanBrand hashtag#District23

"Stop us if you’ve heard this before: A special group of athletes traveled from places far and wide this summer to take on new challenges, and now, they’re in the final countdown for their main event.Who are they? Our Nike interns.Starting in June, more than 200 graduate and undergraduate students from across the United States joined our team at WHQ, immersing themselves in areas of our business from Design to Marketing to Finance and everything in-between. Their capstone is our annual Intern Combine – a four-day pitch competition where teams of interns work together to brainstorm new Nike initiatives from the ground up. Once their plan is set, they present their detailed proposals to leaders across Nike, Jordan and Converse, who give them equally detailed feedback.“The combine experience gave me new tools to work efficiently while under pressure,” says Bryan Santos-Paniagua, a Jordan Brand Marketing intern who is also an undergraduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “Because my teammates worked in different functions across the business, we were also given the resources to think creatively about how to grow Nike. The diverse perspectives from my team meant everybody learned something from each other.”In addition to the combine, the interns are wrapping up their final individual projects specific to the business area they support. As the interns begin to share their final presentations and conclude their summer experience, we celebrate all of their hard-earned, valuable work. “It was exciting to not only work on a project that I was invested in, but to work on a project that my Nike team needed,” says Caro Treviso, a Finance and Sports Marketing intern who is also a graduate student at UCLA (One of Caro’s projects: researching three Jordan Brand World of Flight doors, seeing how the brand can win big). “I love Nike’s environment.

"""Nike is changing the playbook again."" That’s Caroline Rogers Abero, Nike Sr. Design Director of Women’s Color Design for Footwear and Apparel, talking about the Electric Pack — the wild, far-out colorway that you’ll see in Paris. The colorway extends the unmistakable Nike tradition of using bold color choices to stand out on the track, the court, and almost every field of play.  The Electric Pack, co-led by Devon McKinney, was a career highlight for Caroline. For her, the root of the excitement was in seeing her inspiring teammates work together to bring the colorway to the world. Together, they modeled another unmistakable Nike tradition: give talented people the creative freedom to take something that might seem like a small detail, and then maximize its reach into a global moment through deep storytelling.

"At Nike, we believe basketball is more than just a game. It’s an opportunity to break barriers, build community and expand sport for the next generation. The newest N7 collection celebrates the power of the sport within the Indigenous community, something that hits close to home for Nike N7 General Manager Sam McCracken, a member of the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes — and a former girls basketball coach at the high school level for more than 30 years throughout the Western United States.Through his current work with Nike N7, McCracken is committed to help give more Indigenous kids a chance to play basketball and other sports. The N7 Fund provides grants — administered by CAF America — to nonprofits that create youth access to sport in Indigenous communities across North America. This investment continues Nike’s legacy of support for Indigenous communities through the N7 Fund and other grants, totaling over $10.8 million to nearly 300 organizations since 2009.Two of our N7 Fund grantees — the Notah Begay III (NB3) Foundation  and Rise Above — are using the investment to help grow the game for girls. This year, NB3 created its first basketball team for Native American girls (ages 10-13), with an Indigenous woman as its head coach. Rise Above hosted multiple youth basketball clinics and has plans for an all-girls camp next summer.Coincidentally, Rise Above’s Co-Founder, Jaci McCormack, competed as a player against one of McCracken’s varsity girls high school teams in Beaverton, Ore. They may have been on opposing teams, but a shared passion for basketball and their community instantly connected them, says McCracken. “I’m so proud of the impact Jaci’s making, not only on young girls, but on so many kids in our community,” he says.Learn more about how Nike’s tapping into the power of basketball and other sports to level the playing field and build active, inclusive communities at https://lnkd.in/dkRgfFCxhashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#NativeAmericanHeritageMonth hashtag#NikeN7 hashtag#JustDoIt

"Climate change is one of the most existential threats to sport we will ever face. And we know it isn’t just a sports issue — it’s a community issue too. That’s why Nike launched the Community Climate Resilience Program (CCRP) to help provide access to urban green spaces and parks and increase sports participation in the communities that need it most. In the year since CCRP launched, Nike has worked with Trust for Public Land to transform more than 117,000 square feet of public park space in New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles, serving nearly 100,000 adults and children. The positive outcomes have had a powerful impact on the employees working on the project too. “In some cases, we’re going into neighborhoods that are park deserts without walkable access to real green space. By creating and opening these spaces, we’re unlocking the first real public parks for many members of these communities,” says Patrick Reaves, Nike Director of Business Integration for Social and Community Impact, who’s helped lead the program. “The site visits have been especially meaningful. Going from brainstorming this project in our office to seeing tangible change — a finished green schoolyard for a community — is incredibly rewarding. And given the scale of climate inequity, I hope it's a catalyst for even more positive impact.""

"Every year, one of NIKE, Inc.’s most important beliefs — that all kids should have the opportunity to play, regardless of background, gender or ability — comes to life right here on our WHQ campus.Through Nike’s longtime partnership with Special Olympics Oregon (SOOR), we had the privilege of hosting the SOOR Games last weekend, an opportunity to help introduce sport to nearly 500 young athletes with intellectual disabilities while celebrating the joy of movement with them and their families. And just as many Nike employees show up as volunteers. The SOOR Games is one of the fastest -filled employee volunteer events at our company. For many, the experience is an all-time Nike highlight, including for Paige La Flamme, a Nike Business Operations and Planning Lead in Technology Management, who also Co-Chairs Nike’s Disability Network. La Flamme says it’s only fitting that Nike’s spirit of volunteerism is so strong at the event. “The Special Olympics Youth Games is one of my favorite days of the year,” says La Flamme. “As a previous Special Olympics Oregon Intern, this organization and most importantly, the athletes, have a special place in my heart. It's amazing to see the power of the Nike Community come together to celebrate and show the collective strength of disability and the importance of sport through this event.”The SOOR Games are only one example of NIKE, Inc.’s commitment to support accessibility and disability. In honor of National Disability Employment Awareness Month, Nike’s Disability Employee Network will lead a number of events in October that highlight the company’s dedicated hiring programs and the ways in which Nike is increasing accessibility for employees of every background.Learn more about Nike’s employee networks at https://lnkd.in/gcxyit3Shashtag#LifeAtNike hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#Nike hashtag#SOOR

"Nine major U.S. cities. Seventy-eight youth organizations. Two partners who share a common vision: create a space for all girls who ball to find joy in play, and feel seen, empowered and connected to a community — on and off the basketball court.Beginning in 2021, Nike partnered with DICK'S Sporting Goods (DSG) to create “It’s Her Shot,” an experience that hosts hundreds of young girls for games, clinics and programs. The beauty of this partnership, says Mindy Helmer, is in the shared values. The Nike Director of Partner Marketing helps lead conversations between Nike and DSG on how sport can, and should, leave a positive impact on everyone, especially girls.“One of the special parts about working at Nike is getting to work across so many different groups to do a project,” says Helmer, who’s been in the job for nearly three years. “From Social & Community Impact to Communications to Sports Marketing, everyone involved in the program is just as passionate as I am about giving these girls an incredible experience and a newfound community through sport. This project has been a culmination of everything I’ve believed in during my 13-year Nike career about helping young girls find a sense of belonging.”And it's not the only example.

"We observe January 15 as a National Day of Service, closing our U.S.-based Nike, Jordan and Converse offices, distribution centers and Air MI facilities. As Nike athletes, we know the intersection of civil rights and social justice isn’t passive, but participatory. This year, Nike is also celebrating its four-year milestone of the Black Community Commitment (BCC). Launched in 2020, Nike committed $40 million over four years, and Jordan Brand and Michael Jordan committed $100 million over 10 years, together investing in and supporting organizations focused on economic empowerment, education innovation and social justice to address racial inequality for the Black Community in the United States. The BCC Task Force visited Memphis last fall to tour the National Civil Rights Museum, which Nike has supported since 1996, and Nike’s North America Logistics Campus (You can watch some footage of their visit below). The Task Force took the opportunity to speak directly with local Nike teammates and some of the local community organizations that have received BCC grants so far. This is how the success of the BCC must be measured, says Willie Gregory, Nike Sr. Director of Community Relations, Mid-South — by the health of these local organizations who are committed over the long haul to advance racial equity for Black Americans.“If you’re a company, you owe your community the best you can give it,” says Gregory, who's also a BCC Task Force Member. “The BCC shows how Nike is helping the lead the way among companies that are making local communities better. I was born and raised in the city of Memphis. Nike is unique in how it encourages its employees to volunteer to this degree, allowing them to bank volunteer hours that can then be given as donations to the nonprofit of their choice. Making communities better must be a long-term, collaborative effort. That’s the spirit behind the BCC, and that’s the spirit among our employees.”hashtag#NikeBlackCommunityCommitment hashtag#BCC hashtag#JustDoIt

"New parents are some of the hardest working athletes around, and when you’re a new parent on our team, we want to make sure you have the time you need to care for your family. That’s why, as of June 1, we’ve doubled our parental leave benefit from 8 to 16 weeks for all U.S.-based NIKE, Inc. employees — including, for the first time, part-time retail teammates — to give them more time with their child after birth, adoption or foster placement.  For first-time mom Kittorra Stokes, a Nike retail athlete who’s expecting twin girls later this summer, this best-in-class benefit gives personal and professional peace of mind. “With two babies on the way, knowing that I’ll have 16 weeks of paid time to bond with them is such a blessing,” says Kittorra, who’s a part-time administrative assistant at Nike Chicago. “I think this benefit shows how much Nike cares about and supports its people — I know, for me, it reaffirmed why I work here and why I want to stay.” Congrats, Kittorra.

"When Nike’s employee networks mobilize around a cause, they create change that ripples from the inside out.That concept is nothing new for Taya Saxton, a Director of Cross Functional Sustainability at Nike. Taya served over four years in the Air Force, and she’s worked at Nike for almost a decade now, helping lead the company’s supply chain strategy to become more environmentally responsible. As a member of the leadership team on Nike’s Military Veterans and Friends Network (NMV), Saxton and her colleagues saw another opportunity to spearhead: helping shape a paid leave program for Nike’s military employees.“A consistent trait among our military friends is the resolve to find a way, even if you don’t know something,” says Taya. “When I was on active duty in the Air Force, I was immediately placed in an aerospace program. I knew nothing about satellites. But I didn’t have another option. I needed to hunker down and start learning. You find that commitment inside of every Nike military veteran.”The network drafted a detailed proposal for the leave program in 2017, eventually presenting to the company’s senior leadership. The support was resounding. A year later, Nike introduced its military leave program, giving employees who volunteer or are called back to the uniformed services up to 12 weeks of paid time off every 12 months.“The NMV really helped champion the program,” says Taya. “I love how our network gets to focus on showing up for the Nike military community at large, in addition to representing the military experience for all of our employees.”Learn more about how Nike supports the personal and professional well-being of our employees: https://lnkd.in/dpWnGc33hashtag#MemorialDay hashtag#NikeUnited hashtag#NMV hashtag#SwooshLife

"As a senior engineer with Nike’s Air Manufacturing Innovation (Air MI) team, Kristina Nardoni is sworn to secrecy. That’s because she’s at the forefront of Air Bag manufacturing that will appear on Nike’s newest shoes, like the ones you’ll see this summer. She started at Nike in 2017. Previously, her jobs had been in process engineering related to high-voltage equipment. A mentor told her about an opening for a Nike industrial engineering position out of the Air MI facility in Saint Charles, MO. Seven years later, she is using her experience to help launch new products and continue to improve Air Bags that have been beloved for years. “Industrial engineers are working from a zoomed-out place thinking about a system at large,” says Nardoni. “Some people are most concerned about the Air Bag being used. Others are interested in the machines. We get to look the whole system. One example was when we modified a machine on the floor that was giving operators shoulder pain. We saw the problem and saw that the shoulder pain was symptomatic of something else.” Nardoni’s deep look at the whole system is also her filter for seeing the holistic development of her own skills. Through Nike’s tuition reimbursement program, Krissy is earning her master's degree in management. She's taking a class at a time, and if she earns an A or a B, she gets reimbursed for the class. “I’m paying just a couple hundred bucks a year to get my master’s degree when it could be costing me thousands,” she says. Krissy has added to her Nike experience in more ways than just her rising job title. She also served as executive chairwoman of the Women of Nike (WON) employee network. She brought her zoomed-out POV to the position. For example, WON wanted to provide a delicious lunch to Air MI employees who worked nontraditional schedules. So, the team celebrated a midnight cookout together. Her advice to Nike employees: Learn as much as you can. Take advantage of the learning programs that are offered at the company. Be a sponge. “If you see a maintenance technician fixing a chiller at your workplace, ask what they’re working on,” she says. “You never know what you might learn.”hashtag#NikeAirMI hashtag#NikeInnovation hashtag#NikeEngineering hashtag#LifeAtNike

The partnership supported the athletes both in the renowned Nike Sport Research Lab and the roads where they trained and raced across the U.S over the last two years.That support included creating a community of women who rallied each other forward, says Schaich, who works at Nike as a Manager in Strategy and Connected Membership. While Project Dreamweaver runners varied in skill levels, background and hometowns, they were united by a common belief: a dream worth pursuing is worth chasing together. When Schaich toes the starting line this weekend for the Trials in Orlando, she’ll have the collective behind her.“Finding the time to train at the level I want to while working full-time isn’t easy, but being able to have great friends and coworkers I’ve met through this program by my side has made a huge difference,"" says Schaich. ""I doubt there’s a remotely similar community out there that could provide the same level of support and excitement toward others achieving their goals — whether that was the OTQ, a PR, or just overcoming an injury and getting back into running after a hiatus.”Learn more about Project Dreamweaver: https://lnkd.in/d79NDCEzhashtag#ProjectDreamweaver hashtag#NikeRunning hashtag#JustDoIt

He’s worked four different production floor shifts and worked in many different locations, including Nike’s World Headquarters (WHQ) in Beaverton, Ore. He always knew what his ultimate goal was from the minute he was hired in ‘95: to be a supervisor on the production floor at Air MI.

I applied for it and got it, so I went back to manufacturing. Having my former leader reach out to me was extremely rewarding. He saw potential in me, but more importantly, we had a genuine relationship that continued even after I left the team.”Tyler was promoted to Production Manager in 2010 and then Director of Production Operations in 2017, leading different production platforms at Air MI.

Even from the view on your couch, you’ll likely spot those distinct foam pods on the sides of Jayson Tatum’s second signature shoe with Jordan Brand, the Tatum 2. The shoe’s design is rooted in a philosophy that powers Jordan Brand’s approach to performance footwear: get at the motion and emotion behind Tatum’s game, and distill those qualities through every facet of the shoe.For Kelsey “Shme” Amy, Expert Color Designer of Performance Footwear at Jordan Brand, color is her tool to tell Jayson’s story. She started working alongside the All-Star forward in 2019 with the Air Jordan XXXIV. Since then, they’ve worked on six different models together, brainstormed more than 100 colorways, and most important, have forged one solid relationship. It’s not uncommon for Amy to get a text from Jayson, day or night, about a wild new colorway idea. What does she think? Can the team make it happen? For Amy, professional trust from athletes like Jayson might be the single most important factor of her job — and one that she loves.“Our whole team has established a relationship with Jayson where he lets us take a lot of big, bold swings in his shoe design,” says Kelsey. “Those big ideas come to life for me through color. Jayson has an open line of communication with us at any time, because we all want to make his ideas a reality.

"“Running is more than a hobby for me — it’s a lifestyle. But it wasn’t until I was diagnosed with a mild heart disease almost four years ago that I realized how integral running is to my very being.” That’s Naoe Tanaka, Head Coach of Nike Ginza, the new Nike Rise store in the middle of downtown Tokyo. This location is in the heart of one of Japan’s most vibrant running communities, which Nike Ginza is specifically designed to serve through a variety of in-store features and programming. Tanaka’s passion for running led her to start working for Nike last year, and the camaraderie she’s found in the local running community has grounded her work in a deeper sense of purpose, she says. After the frightening diagnosis she mentioned above, she doubled down on finding ways to connect with other runners on what the sport gave her: Hope, healing, adventure and solidarity. And that's what the running programming at Nike Ginza is all about. Through regular events, like Nike Run Club Live group runs, Nike Ginza provides Tokyo’s runners a space where they can savor movement with each other. “Running with other people is something I started doing seriously once I joined the Nike family,” says Tanaka. “I remember my first staff run with my co-workers and feeling at home, supported and motivated in a way I’d never experienced before. What makes Nike so special is the sense of connection to others, and I've felt it firsthand. That’s exactly what I want people to feel when they come to our store: a shared spark that makes you want to redefine what you think is possible.” Read more about Nike Ginza at https://lnkd.in/gQg-gHgdhashtag#NikeGinza hashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#JustDoIt

"The Doernbecher Freestyle XIX Collection releases this Saturday, December 2. The launch includes six of the most creative, imaginative footwear designs you’ll see all year, each of them designed by six young patients from Oregon Health & Science University Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland, Ore., along with a team of Nike creatives. To say it’s one of the most popular volunteer opportunities at NIKE, Inc. is an understatement.  Joining the design process this year was Leslie Howerton, a Senior Manager in Material Operations at the Bowerman Footwear Lab. Her passion for the event is deeply personal. Almost three years ago, her 7-year-old daughter, Winnie, passed away after a long battle with leukemia, and she was treated primarily at Doernbecher. “For these kids who are going through treatment, in the middle of a nightmare they had no say over, they finally have a sense of control over something,” says Leslie about the Freestyle program. “Our Nike teams are here to help make their creative vision a reality, but the kids are in the driver’s seat. The Freestyle process is a great example of what happens when creative outlets put power back into the hands of kids.”Never underestimate the power of some cool shoes, says Leslie. She saw that first-hand with Winnie. As she was receiving treatment, Winnie received a pair of custom Air Force 1s with pink, sparkly rainbows and unicorns on them — lovingly designed by Leslie’s Nike teammates in the Bowerman Footwear Lab. Leslie remembers how Doernbecher’s nurses would walk into Winnie’s room and shower her with compliments on the shoes. Winnie would smile, saying how the design was the only one, and adding that the shoes made her feel famous.“That’s what shoes can do,” says Leslie. “These Freestyle patient designers get to step outside of their medical situation and feel famous, too.”Learn more about the Doernbecher Freestyle XIX Collection at: https://lnkd.in/g5Snvbsahashtag#DoernbecherFreestyle hashtag#OHSU hashtag#SwooshLife

Last week, Nike and Football Australia announced a 10-year contract extension, which will continue to support all levels of the game in the country, from Australia’s elite national teams, the Matildas and Socceroos (senior, youth, para), through to grassroots programs. Nike’s investment will also focus on Football Australia’s Legacy ’23 strategy, increasing access to the game for young girls and women. This strategy is driven by an audacious goal: to make football the nation’s first sport to reach gender parity in participation. Bold? Yes. Possible? Absolutely — especially when passionate people on both sides are committed to dreaming big.  For Chris Incoll, Nike Sports Marketing Lead in Pacific Australia, his day-to-day work demands this kind of thinking, alongside national leagues and organizations, to bring about lasting change. The momentum created by the past two major tournaments for the men in 2022 and women in 2023 is just the beginning. “It’s a privilege to work closely with Football Australia to build generational impact across the sport,” says Chris. “I strongly believe in the power of sport to bring people together and change their communities for the better. Delivering on a shared vision and purpose with Football Australia has been the highlight of my 13-year career at Nike.”Learn more about our extended partnership: https://lnkd.in/gMde92FRhashtag#NikeFootball hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#GrowTheGame

"Hold up. A revolutionary midsole foam derived from aerospace engineering...appearing in Nike’s record-breaking marathon shoes…now for basketball? 👀  This is the kind of futuristic design you can expect in Nike Basketball's “Greater Than” series, which just welcomed its newest addition: the G.T. Cut 3, marking the first time our Nike ZoomX Foam has appeared in a basketball shoe. Ben DeSanno, a senior product line manager with Nike Basketball, works with a team that's empowered to use the latest Nike technology to improve what players can achieve on the court, helping them uncover every possible edge over their opponent. The debut of ZoomX Foam is a huge moment for basketball performance — but there was another part of the launch that was especially satisfying for Ben. “The G.T. Cut 3 is the first time we’ll release both a kids-specific version and a lower-priced version with similar performance benefits in mind,"" says DeSanno. “We talk a lot here about expanding access to basketball for everyone. The launch of the G.T. Cut 3 is a major way we’re doing that through product design. It’s changing the game for even more people.” Learn more about the G.T.

"When babies learn to walk, it’s like going from 0 to 100 — they GO. Parents know best of all how quickly toddlers morph from crawling to walking. So when Fanny Yung Ho became a parent herself, she realized she was in a unique position to design product that helped promote the early walking patterns for our littlest athletes.“As a footwear designer with 15 years of experience, I realized I actually have the skillset and the expertise to help design a better product for toddlers learning to walk,” says Fanny, a Nike Senior Manager in Design Innovation, NXT. “My teammates approached some of our colleagues on the knit team and asked how we could create a seamless, 360-degree Flyknit bootie. The Swoosh 1 took off from there out of that partnership.”Read more about the Nike Swoosh 1, the brand’s latest kids-first innovation: https://lnkd.in/gAXjDppNhashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#NikeSwoosh1 hashtag#NikeDesign

"Cathy Swearengen-Duncan, an area manager at the Nike Distribution Center in Memphis, is no stranger to doing good work for her community. Growing up in North Memphis, Cathy’s parents were local apartment managers, she spent lots of time at the Hollywood Community Center after school and she had several relatives who were involved in local politics. She learned early-on the importance of community, giving back and trying to lift up those around you. So when Cathy was given an opportunity to join her local Employee Grant Selection Committee for the Nike Community Impact Fund (NCIF), Nike’s employee-led, neighborhood-focused approach to grant-making, she couldn’t say yes fast enough. “Whenever anyone is looking for volunteers, I raise my hand. It just matters to me,” she says. Each committee member is trained on how to assess grant applications, and then they share their insights — as individuals who live, work and play in the areas they’re representing — to decide which organizations should receive funding. She's reviewed between 75 and 80 applications. Even as someone who volunteers frequently, she says, she was overjoyed that there were so many people who wanted to help others in the community. The review process is time-consuming, but it wasn’t the hours logged that proved to be the most difficult part for Cathy. The committee members had to ask themselves some tough questions to make their final selections: How many people are they trying to help? How are they engaging kids? What’s their lasting impact? While each Nike teammate can only serve on their local NCIF Employee Grant Selection Committee once, Cathy is committed to finding other ways she can continue to make a difference through Nike. “Every time I go out into the community and meet someone connected to a nonprofit, I spread the word about NCIF and tell them to submit an application,” she says. “To see Nike help support these nonprofits in doing their work is amazing.” Learn more about the Nike Community Impact Fund at https://lnkd.in/eFqiD3YV hashtag#NCIF hashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#JustDoIt

"Globally, 45 percent of teenage girls are dropping out of sport — that’s twice the rate of boys — and one of the biggest reasons is the impact a sports environment can have on their body confidence and self-esteem. That’s why Nike and Dove have partnered to launch Body Confident Sport, a first-of-its-kind set of tools for coaching 11- to 17-year-old girls that will help build their body confidence and make them feel like sport is a place where they belong.We know coaches are uniquely positioned to help positively influence girls’ perceptions of their bodies, and this new tool is scientifically proven to improve self-esteem and body confidence for girls. “The efficacy of this program is a huge part of why we are so eager to get it into the hands of coaches everywhere — it works!” says Kelsey Moore, Made to Play Director for North America Social and Community Impact, who worked closely on the partnership. “This project has also transformed my own mindset. As the mother of two young daughters, I plan to model body confidence and do everything in my power to ensure their sport experience is one that helps them reap all the benefits. I want sport and movement to build their confidence, help them understand their power and appreciate what their bodies can do, not what they look like.”  Find out more about the free tool and how you can get involved: https://lnkd.in/ewJ3WRNY hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#BodyConfidence hashtag#MadeToPlay

"Breaking down barriers is what we do at Nike — on and off the field. We were proud to take part in the 10th Annual Lesbians Who Tech & Allies Summit and help bring a message of inclusivity to future and current NIKE, Inc. teammates.

"Nike’s Business Diversity & Inclusion (BDI) program addresses a straightforward question: How can Nike work with more diverse suppliers? After launching its first North American cohort, Nike BDI is expanding to the City of Lights. Like in North America, Nike’s Parisian BDI program is manifested in the Academy, a four-month program that brings together 15 diverse-owned agencies to address opportunities from the Nike Paris Marketing team ahead of next summer's games in France. Covering event planning and communications, these agencies represent ethnic minority and immigrant-owned, women-owned and disabled-owned businesses. The Academy culminates with a graduation in early 2024. Bruna Braga van Bree, Nike Lead for Procurement Programs in EMEA, leads a team that’s setting a national precedent for supplier diversity in a large company. The data behind supplier diversity isn’t as widely available in Europe as it is in North America, says Bruna, so she and her teammates led a detailed, from-scratch strategy and partnered with diverse supplier advocacy groups who are also leading the industry in France. “BDI is not purely a corporate social responsibility, purpose, or procurement initiative, separate from how the core business works,” says Bruna. “Our program is embedded in Nike’s business model. And it’s putting money in the hands of business owners who, in turn, help make Nike a better company."" Before Nike, Bruna spent a decade working in the nonprofit sector. She finds great personal inspiration in her work, she says, because it brings a sense of purpose to everyday business decisions. “I think about one of the maxims here at Nike: 'Win as a team,'” says Bruna. “No one company is going to solve a problem like underrepresentation of diverse businesses by itself,” says Bruna. “Every company can work with diverse suppliers and be part of the solution.” Learn more about Nike’s North American BDI Academy Program here: https://lnkd.in/gBauGUJfhashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#WinAsATeam hashtag#NikeBDI
