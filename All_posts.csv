"2022 - No Pay Increase ðŸ˜“ 2023 - No Pay Increase ðŸ˜“ 2024 - No Pay Increase ðŸ˜“  Employee - Boss please accept my resignation. Boss - Oh! What Happened?  Employee - Got a better opportunity and Salary. Boss - How much more?  Employee - 45%  After few days.....  Boss - We will match it, can you stay with us, we need you here?! Employee - Sorry it's too late.  Moral of the story.  Leaders should listen to and take care of the talent before it's too late. Because employees will go where they are valued and compensated.  The best employees don't leave because they stop liking their job. They leave because they feel undervalued and underappreciated. Consistent pay stagnation signals a lack of growth and recognition.  It's not just about the money; it's about respect and acknowledgment. A competitive salary is a sign that an employer values your contributions and wants to invest in your future.  Retention starts with appreciation. Proactive leadership means listening, rewarding, and recognizing talent regularly. Don't wait until they're out the door to offer what they deserved all along.  Invest in your people today, because the cost of losing top talent is far greater than you might think.  hashtag#hr hashtag#humanresources hashtag#employeeexperience hashtag#talent hashtag#hiring hashtag#leaders hashtag#people hashtag#leadership hashtag#jobs hashtag#jobseekers hashtag#culture hashtag#culturematters hashtag#business hashtag#growth hashtag#branding hashtag#strategy hashtag#hrstrategy hashtag#interviews hashtag#tips hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#talentnexa hashtag#aach

"My post may offend someone, but I feel compelled to show a mirror to those who especially Samira Iftikhar , Rabia Pervaiz at Ninesol Technologies NineSol Technologies consider themselves as untouchable in this world, forgetting that there is a higher power above them. It's often said that what goes around comes around. We've seen managers who misuse their power, mistreat employees, and act solely for their own benefit. Despite raising these concerns with higher-ups, our voices were ignored. I don't know how many girls and boys have lost their future, honor, and livelihood because of their actions. Now, the tables have turned, and those who caused so much harm are facing the consequences.This is a reminder to everyone: leadership is about uplifting others, not tearing them down. The corporate world has its way of balancing the scales. Note: I commend the organization for taking a positive step in this direction and hope to see more actions like this in the future.Muhammad Fayyazhajra wahidMumtaz RajperHamza Tariq BaigUmer MerajMuhammad QasimKhawar MalikAkash MushtaqMehran NadeemFaizan SaqlainPawan Paritem ðŸ‡µðŸ‡°Syed HaseebMirza Alihashtag#Leadership hashtag#Karma hashtag#WorkplaceCulture hashtag#Accountability hashtag#Makafat_e_amalhashtag#MobileApps hashtag#Ninesol hashtag#NinesolTechnology hashtag#LinkedInFamily

"A pioneering strategy has been developed to digitalize the transport system in Rawalpindi, marking a first in Pakistan. The Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) will create the software for this digital public transport system, which will include a control room and an e-tag system at the Pirwadhai Bus Terminal. This system will gather comprehensive data on vehicles at the terminal, such as registration numbers, owner's details, fitness certificates, and route information. It aims to enhance road and passenger safety by ensuring only vehicles that meet safety standards are allowed to operate.The digitized transport system, modeled after those in Paris, London, and the United States, will serve as a blueprint for future projects across Punjab. Once completed, the project will not only improve travel comfort and vehicle fitness levels but also allow citizens to file online complaints against public and government transport services. Rashid Ali, Secretary of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA), described the project as a ""masterpiece,"" with IT facilities provided by the Punjab Government's IT sector. Senior officials are set to visit Rawalpindi on September 2 to finalize the plans.hashtag#IT hashtag#RTA hashtag#Digital hashtag#Rawalpindi
